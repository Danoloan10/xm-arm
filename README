= Build instructions =

In order to build XtratuM, first configure the build by setting the appropriate
variables in the xmconfig.sparc file. There, set TARGET_CCPATH to the root of
the ARM compiler toolchain. You may configure flags and prefixes as well. Then,
copy `xmconfig.sparc` to `xmconfig`, and run `make menuconfig`. Go through the
steps to configure all the three components, exiting each prompt to continue.
Lastly, run make to build XtratuM.
