# Example : example.006

# Description
This example shows how to switch between the cyclic scheduling plans defined in the configuration file. 

# Partition definition
There are three partitions.
P0 and P1 user partitions.
P2 is a system partition.

# Configuration table
There have been defined multiple scheduling plans. These plans are the following:

MAF = 2000 msec 		
P2: S    0 ms  D 400 ms
P0: S  400 ms  D 400 ms
P1: S  800 ms  D 400 ms
P0: S 1200 ms  D 400 ms
P1: S 1600 ms  D 400 ms

MAF = 1200 msec 		
P2: S    0 ms  D 400 ms
P0: S  400 ms  D 400 ms
P1: S  800 ms  D 400 ms

MAF = 800 msec 		
P2: S    0 ms  D 400 ms
P1: S  400 ms  D 400 ms

# Expected results
\xm{} will load, initialise and run in user mode partitions P0 and P1, and in system mode partition P2.
During the execution, at each new slot, each partition will write its ID and will idle until the next slot. P2 is a system partition and will
change the scheduling plan after the MAF has been repeated for 5 times.

Note: Plan 0 is the initial plan. It is not possible to come back to it once other plan is scheduled. Therefore, any attempt to switch to plan 0 will fail.

Notice that, despite P2 is the first to run and it will request a plan change at the beginning of the MAF, the plans will only change at the end of the MAF.
The execution never ends.
