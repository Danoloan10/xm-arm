# Example : example.004

# Description
This example shows how to use the channels and the shared memory for inter-partition communication. Shared memory feature will be available only if XtratuM has been compile using (CONFIG_MPU & CONFIG_AT697F) or (CONFIG_MMU) flags

# Partition definition
There are three partitions.
P0 will write to the queuing and sampling channels.
P1 will read from the queueing and sampling channels and will write on shared memory.
P2 will read from the sampling channel and from the shared memory.

NOTE: Shared memory feature will be available only if XtratuM has been compile using (CONFIG_MPU & CONFIG_AT697F) or (CONFIG_MMU) flags

# Configuration table
P0 has write access to a portQ queuing port and a portS sampling port.
P1 has read access to a portQ queuing port and a portS sampling port and has access to shared memory.
P2 has read access to a portS sampling port and has access to shared memory.

NOTE: Shared memory feature will be available only if XtratuM has been compile using (CONFIG_MPU & CONFIG_AT697F) or (CONFIG_MMU) flags

A scheduling plan is defined under the following premises:

MAF = 1500 msec 		
P0: S    0 ms  D 500 ms
P1: S  500 ms  D 500 ms
P2: S 1000 ms  D 500 ms

# Expected results
\xm{} will load, initialise and run in user mode the partitions. 
During the execution, P0 will write a sampling message and a queuing message.
P1 will read both queuing and sampling messages and will write on shared memory the number of queuing messages received.
P2 will read the sampling message and the
shared memory.
All of them will print the information sent and received.

NOTE: Shared memory feature will be available only if XtratuM has been compile using (CONFIG_MPU & CONFIG_AT697F) or (CONFIG_MMU) flags
