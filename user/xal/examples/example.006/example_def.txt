# Example : example.007

# Description

Test the ability to use some specific hypercalls by a system partition and to control the execution of other partitions.

# Partition definition
This test uses 3 partitions. P1 and P2 (same code partition.c).
P0 will control the execution of P1 and P2.

P0 will call the following hypercalls:
 - XM_suspend_partition
 - XM_get_partition_status
 - XM_resume_partition
 - XM_halt_partition
 - XM_reset_partition
 - XM_halt_system

which only can be used by system partitions.
P1 and P2 print a counter and wait for the next slot.

# Configuration table
Basic configuration.
P0 is system partition.
P1 and P2 are user partitions.

MAF = 2500 msec
P1: S    0 ms  D 500 ms
P2: S  500 ms  D 500 ms
P3: S 1000 ms  D 500 ms
P2: S 1500 ms  D 500 ms
P3: S 2000 ms  D 500 ms

# Expected results
\xm{} will load, initialise and run in user mode partitions P1 and P2, and in system mode partition P0.
During the execution, P0 will use the instructions reserved for system partitions to suspend, resume, halt and reset to control the execution of P1 and P2.
