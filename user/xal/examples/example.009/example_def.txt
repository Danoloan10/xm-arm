# Example : example.009

# Description
This example shows how the access to DDR is performed.

# Partition definition
There are two partition that will access DDR memory with different conditions.

# Test Configuration
you must define the test number in the ddr.c.  This test has 4 variants.
Please set the macro called "TEST" with a valid value [1-4].

*Variant 1
Partition access its own memory.

*Variant 2
Partition access its own memory but is not mapped (unmaped in the test).

*Variant 3
Partition access  out of its own memory. Before the access the partition mapps the memory.

*Variant 4
Partition access  out of its own memory. Before the access the partition does not mapp the memory.


# Configuration table
Basic configuration.

A scheduling plan is defined under the following premises:

MAF = 2 sec
P0: S   0   ms  D 250 ms
P1: S   500 ms  D 250 ms

# Expected results
\xm{} will load, initialise and run in user mode the partition. 
During the execution, the partition will access the memory and halt.

*Variant 1
Partition access memory.
No fail is reported.

*Variant 2
DataAbort is expected (MMU Abort).

*Variant 3
DataAbort is expected (TrustZone Abort).

*Variant 4
DataAbort is expected (MMU Abort).
